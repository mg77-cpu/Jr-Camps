# Trust, Safety & Compliance Protocol

## 1. The "Turnkey" Promise (Visualized)
Whenever explaining our service to Partners, use a "3-Step Process" component:
1.  **We Bring the Staff** (Icon: `IdCard` - Live Scan Verified).
2.  **We Bring the Gear** (Icon: `Package` - All equipment included).
3.  **We Handle Admin** (Icon: `Laptop` - Payments & Waivers).

## 2. The Safety Shield
* **Background Checks:** The phrase "Live Scan Background Checked" must appear near every staff photo.
* **Certifications:** "CPR/First Aid Certified" must be mentioned in the footer and About page.

## 3. Compliance Language (For HOAs/Cities)
* When targeting Apartments, explicitly mention: "LURA Compliance" and "Tenant Retention."
* When targeting Schools, explicitly mention: "Liability Insured" and "No Front-Office Work."
