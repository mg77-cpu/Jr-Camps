# Audience Strategy
Parent messaging vs Partner messaging.
# Audience Strategy & User Personas

## 1. The Separation of Church and State
This website has two distinct front doors.
* **Door A (Parents):** Emotional, visual, focused on child benefit.
* **Door B (Partners):** Logical, data-driven, focused on ease of implementation.

## 2. Persona A: "The Busy Parent" (B2C)
* **Primary Motivation:** Guilt alleviation ("I want my kid active, not on an iPad").
* **Key Triggers:** "Safety," "Skill-Building," "Convenience."
* **Voice:** Warm, exciting, reassuring.
* **Mandatory UI Element:** "Find a Location" or "Register Now" must be the primary CTA.

## 3. Persona B: "The Site Director" (B2B - Schools/Cities/HOAs)
* **Primary Motivation:** Removing headache ("I need programming but don't have staff").
* **Key Triggers:** "Turnkey," "Liability Insured," "Revenue Share," "LURA Compliance."
* **Voice:** Professional, efficient, corporate capability.
* **Mandatory UI Element:** "Become a Partner" or "Get the Turnkey Guide."

## 4. Navigation Rules
* The Navbar must clearly split: "For Parents" vs. "For Schools & Cities."
* Never mix "Revenue Share" language on a page meant for Parents.
