# Product Pillars & Visual Schema

## 1. The "Three Pillars" Rule
Every time we display our programs, they must appear in this order with these exact assets.

* **Icon:** `Lucide: Trophy` or `Activity`.
* **Color:** `brand-blue` (Trust/Activity).
* **Keywords:** Soccer, Basketball, Flag Football, "Off Screens."

### 🔬 Jr STEM
* **Tagline:** "Innovate. Build. Discover."
* **Icon:** `Lucide: FlaskConical` or `Cpu`.
* **Color:** `brand-orange` (Creativity/Energy).
* **Keywords:** Robotics, Chemistry, Slime, Coding, Engineering.

### 🛡️ Jr Defense

* **Icon:** `Lucide: ShieldCheck`.
* **Color:** `brand-teal` or `slate-600` (Strength/Calm).

## 2. Layout Rules
* **The Trinity:** Always display these three side-by-side in a 3-column grid on desktop.
* **Imagery:** Jr Sports images must show *movement*. STEM images must show *focus*. Defense images must show *confidence* (not violence).
