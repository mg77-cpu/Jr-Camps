# Jr Camps: Core Mission & Business Model

Jr Camps is a premier youth enrichment provider that turns "idle time" into "active learning." We specialize in bringing high-quality After-School Sports, STEM, and Self-Defense programs directly to the places where children live and learn—Schools, City Recreation Centers, and Apartment Communities.

## 1. Our Core Curriculum (The "Three Pillars")
We don't just offer "daycare"; we offer specialized skill-building in three distinct areas:
* ⚽ **Jr Sports**: Focused on agility, teamwork, and sportsmanship. We run clinics for Soccer, Basketball, Flag Football, and Multi-Sport athletics designed to get kids moving and off screens.
* 🔬 **Jr STEM**: Hands-on innovation labs where children build robots, conduct chemistry experiments (like slime and volcanoes), and learn the basics of coding and engineering.
* 🛡️ **Jr Defense**: A unique safety curriculum teaching situational awareness, "verbal judo" (de-escalation), anti-bullying strategies, and non-violent self-defense techniques to build confidence.

## 2. Who We Serve (Our Partners)
We operate as a B2B Solution for organizations that need youth programming but don't have the staff or expertise to run it themselves.
* **For Schools**: We provide a turnkey after-school solution. We handle the insurance, hiring, and registration, allowing the school to offer enrichment without adding work to their front office.
* **For Cities & Rec Centers**: We fill their "Activity Guides" with reliable programming, operating on a revenue-share model that generates income for the municipality.
* **For Communities (HOAs/Apartments)**: We provide on-site resident services that increase tenant retention and meet government compliance (LURA) requirements for affordable housing.

## 3. The "Turnkey" Promise
The biggest differentiator of Jr Camps is that we handle everything.
* **We bring the Staff**: All coaches are Live Scan background-checked, trained, and CPR certified.
* **We bring the Gear**: From soccer balls to robotics kits, we bring the equipment to the site.
* **We handle the Admin**: Our digital platform handles liability waivers, payments, and parent communication.

**In Short:**
Jr Camps solves the "3:00 PM Gap." We give parents a safe, educational place for their children to go after school, and we give schools and cities a trusted partner to run it.
