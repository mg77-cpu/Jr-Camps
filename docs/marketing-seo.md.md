# SEO & Conversion Strategy

## 1. Technical SEO Rules
* **H-Tag Hierarchy:** Every page must have exactly ONE `<h1 className="...">` containing the primary keyword (e.g., "After-School Sports Programs").
* **Metadata:** Every component generated must include fields for `title` and `meta description`.
* **Alt Text:** All images must have descriptive alt text focusing on the activity (e.g., "Student building a robot in Jr STEM class").

## 2. Conversion Architecture (CRO)
* **The "Sticky" CTA:** On Mobile views, the "Register Now" (Parents) or "Partner with Us" (B2B) button should be fixed to the bottom of the viewport.
* **Social Proof Placement:** Never list a price or a service without a testimonial or "Trust Badge" (e.g., "Trusted by 50+ Schools") visible in the same viewport.
* **Scannability:** Use bullet points with checkmark icons (`✓`) for benefits. Avoid paragraphs longer than 3 lines.

## 3. URL Structure
* `jrcamps.com/programs/[program-name]` (e.g., /programs/jr-stem)
* `jrcamps.com/locations/[city-name]` (e.g., /locations/irvine)
